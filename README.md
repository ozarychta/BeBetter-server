# BeBetter-server

BeBetter is a mobile habit tracker application with social elements and reward system.

Users can create challenges (habits) and track progress in completing that challenges. Many users can join one challenge and have a conversation in the form of comments. For completing goals users are rewarded with ranking points and achievements, which are visible on userâ€™s profile page. 
(More about BeBetter functionalities in [BeBetter-client](https://github.com/ozarychta/BeBetter-client) README file.)

Project is still under development - additional funcionalities will be added and refactoring will be done.
